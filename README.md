A small personal dimension, perfect for all your secret keeping needs

## A Note on Oneironaut interop:
In order to use Oneironaut with this mod you must use the most recent version present in the [Hexxy4 modpack repo](https://github.com/ChloeTax/hexxy4/blob/main/mods/oneironaut-fabric-1.20.1-0.5.0.jar), or the version present on this [repo](https://github.com/Real-Septicake/HexxyPlanes/blob/main/libs/oneironaut-fabric-1.20.1-0.5.0-ad811dc.jar) (direct links to Oneironaut JAR files). The file downloaded by the current version of the PackWiz file as of 12/22/2025 _will not work_.

### Issues pertaining to a `NoClassDefFoundError` will not be handled unless you show that you have gotten the most recent version from either of the linked locations.
